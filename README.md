# 👋 Hey, I’m Bugeez

**Software Engineer | Systems Explorer | Cloud Builder**

Welcome to my slice of GitHub — where browser-based experiences meet backend precision and low-level curiosity meets high-level impact.

## 🧠 What I Do

🔧 **Build scalable, reactive applications**  
I specialize in **Angular**, **AWS Amplify**, and **Serverless** architectures, crafting dynamic frontends and real-time systems that run at scale.

🧬 **Design resilient infrastructure**  
With **Terraform**, **ECS**, and **Lambda**, I automate cloud deployments and build fault-tolerant backends that evolve with the product.

🦀 **Explore the power of Rust**  
I’m currently working with **Rust** to write fast, safe, and expressive backend tools and CLI apps — with a strong focus on correctness and performance.

🎮 **Experiment with C++ and game development**  
In my spare time, I explore the world of graphics and game engines using **SFML** and **SDL**, learning the art of memory, rendering, and interaction.
